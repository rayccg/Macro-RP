## Introduction

In many countries, fiscal policy is viewed as a direct means of achieving inclusive development objectives, frequently articulated as twin goals of sustained growth and low poverty (often achieved through low unemployment). However, fiscal policy shocks often occur in multifaceted ways, with simultaneous changes in both revenue and expenditure-side elements of the fiscal balance, making it difficult to disentangle the effects of any one particular policy.

This study attempts to identify the effect of the following fiscal policy instruments: tax policy, public investment expenditures, and social transfers, on both unemployment and output in the Australian context, using Bayesian Structural Vector Autoregression (BSVAR) approach.

The analysis is guided by the work of Abubakar, Attahir B. (2016), which used a SVAR approach to estimate the effect of public expenditures and public revenues on Nigerian output and unemployment. This study extends this work by using a more extensive dataset, involving more disaggregated revenue and expenditure variables, the inclusion of monetary policy control variables, as well as through the use of Bayesian estimation.

## Data sources

Quarterly data from Q1 1990 to Q4 2022 was sourced from the Australian Bureau of Statistics and the Reserve Bank of Australia and extracted using the `readabs` and `readrba` packages in `R`.

Outcome variables:

-   Unemployment rate and nominal GDP

Explanatory variables of interest

-   Revenue: Tax and non-tax (gross income less tax) revenue

-   Spending: Public gross fixed capital formation and social assistance payments, government final consumption

Control variables:

-   Monetary policy: cash rate target and M3 money supply

As seen in the figures below, Australian GDP output has been on a relatively steady, upward trend since 1990, along with fiscal revenue and spending. These have been largely accommodated by lowering of interest rates and an expanding money supply. Overall, these have been associated with a downward, albeit volatile trajectory in the unemployment rate. Following the advice of Doppelt (2021), the data is left in original, seasonally-unadjusted form but will be transformed into natural log terms during the analysis.

## Preliminary data analysis

### ACF and PACF analysis

ACF plots show strong, positive, and gradually decaying autocorrelation structures across all variables. Moreover the PACF plots indicate a near-one value at the first lag and much lower, mostly statistically zero values at higher lag orders. These characteristics may be indicating that the variables are following a random walk with drift process and as such may be unit-root non-stationary.

```{r ACF and PACF analysis, echo = FALSE}
par(mfrow=c(3,3), mar=c(2,2,2,2))
for (i in 1:9){
  Acf(lnY.df[,i], main = "", ylim = c(-0.2,1))
  title(main = paste(varname_vec[i]), line = 0.5)
} 
for (i in 1:9){
  pacf(lnY.df[,i], main = "", ylim = c(-0.2,1))
  title(main = paste(varname_vec[i]), line = 0.5)
} 

```

### Augmented Dickey-Fuller test for unit roots

```{r Ng-Perron ADF test function, message = FALSE}
#function to implement the Ng and Perron (1998) ADF test procedure
ngperronADF <- function(y){
  T <- length(y)
  kmax <- ceiling(12*(((T-25)/100)^(1/4)))
  k <- kmax + 1
  # run test regression until t-value of lasgt lag > 1.6
  t <- 0
  while(abs(t) < 1.6){
      k <- k - 1
      adft <- ur.df(y, type = "drift", lags = k)
      t <- as.numeric(adft@testreg$coefficients[k+2,][3])
  }
  adft_k <-ur.df(y, type = "drift", lags = k)
  teststat <- adft_k@teststat[2]
  cval <- adft_k@cval[2,2]
  sig <- abs(teststat)>abs(cval)
  return(list("stat" = teststat,"crit" = cval,"reject" = sig))
}

```

```{r ADF test and order of integration determination, echo = FALSE}

adf_results_lev <- c()
adf_results_fd <- c()
adf_results_fd2 <- c()

for (i in 1:9){
npadf_lev <- ngperronADF(lnY.df[,i])

npadf_fd2 <- ngperronADF(diff(diff(lnY.df[,i])[-1])[-1])

## Model specification

### Structural form (SF) model

The following SVAR model is specified to represent the system through which the included variables are jointly determined:

$$
\begin{align}
B_0y_t &= b_0 + B_1 y_{t-1} + \dots + b_p y_{t-p} + u_t\\
u_{t}| Y_{t-1} &\sim _{iid} ( 0, I_N)
\end{align}
$$ Where $y_t$ is a vector of endogenous variables:

$$y_t=\begin{pmatrix} unemp_t &= \text{unemployment rate}
\\ nomgdp_t &= \text{nominal GDP}
\\ totaltax_t  &= \text{tax revenue}
\\ nontax_t  &= \text{non-tax revenue}
\\ pubinv_t  &= \text{government gross fixed capital formation}
\\ pubtrans_t  &= \text{social assitance and benefits payments}
\\ pubcons_t  &= \text{government final consumption}
\\ cashrate_t  &= \text{cash rate target}
\\ M3_t  &= \text{M3 money supply}
\end{pmatrix}$$

and the structural matrix $B_0$ summarizes the contemporaneous relationships between these variables.

### Reduced form (RF) model

$$
\begin{align}
y_t &= \mu_0 + A_1 y_{t-1} + \dots + A_p y_{t-p} + \varepsilon_t\\
\text{where }B_0^{-1}u_t &= \varepsilon_t| Y_{t-1} \sim _{iid} ( 0, \Sigma)\\
\Sigma &= B_0^{-1}B_0^{-1'}
\end{align}
$$

The study will examine impluse response functions and
